Adapt is a free and easy to use framework and authoring tool that creates fully responsive, multi-device, HTML5 e-learning content.

**Important Note:** Adapt no longer supports IE8, 9 & 10. If you need support for those browsers, please use [the legacy branch of Adapt](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/tree/legacy) instead.

## What Does It Do?
The Adapt framework is a toolkit for creating responsive, single-version HTML5 e-learning courses for delivery on a web server or SCORM-compliant learning management system.

We've also created a [server-based authoring tool](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/) for creating courses using the framework.
