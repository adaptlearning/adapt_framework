Adapt is a free and easy to use framework and authoring tool that creates fully responsive, multi-device, HTML5 e-learning content.

## What Does It Do?  
The Adapt framework is a toolkit for creating responsive, single-version HTML5 e-learning courses for delivery on a web server or SCORM-compliant learning management system. 

We've also created a [server-based authoring tool](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/) for creating courses using the framework.
