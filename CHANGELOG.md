## [2.0.0] - 2015-08-03

This release is by far the biggest we’ve ever done; with the help of 17 contributors, the adapt_framework repository alone has seen over 420 commits, more than 6,400 additions and in excess of 13,400 deletions since we put out version 1.1.1.

- Adapt now supports right-to-left languages such as Arabic and Hebrew.

- In addition to SCORM-compliant LMS support, spoor now also allows for offline tracking.
- Accordion items can now contain images.
- The narrative navigation buttons can be configured to show in the display text box.
