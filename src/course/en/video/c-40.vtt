Responsive design means you can create a course once

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:07.024
but view it on a wide range of browsers, devices or operating systems.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.838
This is achieved by using fluid layouts

00:00:08.863 --> 00:00:11.166
to ensure the presentation of content

00:00:11.193 --> 00:00:13.371
is tailored to suit the size of the screen.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.314
This means you can start a course on your laptop

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:20.000
and finish it later on your mobile or tablet.
